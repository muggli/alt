This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

## Overview

This project was done at the start of 2022 as a quick conversion to Angular of an old website I was hosting that utilized moodle (https://moodle.org/). I did this as an effort to move all my website creations completely into github, without requiring any hosting/databases.

While there is most definitely areas where this code can be refactored (such as dynamically generating json files rather than hardcoding), it was quick and easy enough to do things the way I did to preserve my old work.  I also managed to keep the interface similar (with slight enhancements where possible) with how I had done it using moodle, which allowed a streamlined experience on the conversion.
